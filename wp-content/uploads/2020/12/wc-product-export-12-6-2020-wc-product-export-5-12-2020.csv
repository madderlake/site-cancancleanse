\n<h3>Who should do a 10-Day Cleanse?</h3>
\nThis cleanse is for my experienced cleansers who have CAN CAN'ed before and would like to commit their bodies and minds to an extended cleanse program to deeply reflect, rest and make a commitment to change their bad habits for good! Designed for clients who are looking for a full departure from their current eating habits, this rigorous practice is best described as lifestyle altering and created to help clients focus on the importance of taking care of their bodies for long-term health and wellness.
